# My Amazing UQ Method
## Abstract
_Abstract should have 3 to 4 sentences on the method, plus links to paper(s) and/or implementations which are a good starting point._

## Easy to apply ⭐️★★★★
_How hard is the method to implement? Is a deep understanding of the theory behind the method necessary?_

## Data Compatibility ⭐️⭐️★★★
_Is the method compatible with a wide range of data types/sizes/labels/… Are there any restrictions in applicability?_

## Task Compatibility ⭐️⭐️⭐️★★
_Is the method compatible with a wide range of different tasks? Are there any restrictions in applicability? How is the OOD behaviour? Is calibration required?_

## Ease of integration ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️★
_Is the method easy to integrate into an existing pipeline? Does it require model modifications? Does it require retraining? Are there any architectural requirements for the model?_

## Computationally Cheap ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
_Is the use of the method cheap in terms of computational cost? Is there a difference between training and inference steps?_

## Caveats
* _Does the method have any general caveats? Does it have any caveats for specific tasks or in specific cases?_
